# JavaScript Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in JavaScript code related to handling null values. The original code has a function that returns 0 when either input is null. This might not always be the desired behavior. The solution provides an alternative approach for users who wish to treat null as undefined or throw an error instead.
